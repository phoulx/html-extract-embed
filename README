You will be given a sample HTML file that contains a few entries. Extract information from each entry.

In each entry, extract:

    Title
    Action
    Text
    Link
    Timestamp
    Products

Here’s a labeled example below. Note that "Text" is "Hush Phone Office" and "Link" is the actual URL.

In the example above, the “Text” value is just “Hush Phone Office”, but it can also be text like “//example_link”, Create a new column called cleaned_text that cleans up the text from the “Text” column.

    Remove non alphanumeric characters
    Replace slashes, dashes, and underscores with spaces
    Remove things like https, www., .com, etc.

Embed the clean_text column using SentenceTransformers. Store the embedding in a local Qdrant database, and store all attributes (Title, Action, Text, Link, Timestamp, Products, and Cleaned_Text) in the payload.

Build a simple electron app lets you upload HTML files to process. 

Bonus: add the ability to search the database using semantic search through Qdrant in the electron app. 

Implement this in Javascript for frontend and Python for everything else.
